# Eye Timer

This project was made as a term project for my CS20 high school class. The concept was to provide a timer that alerted device users that they were straining their eyes. This was done by following a rule of thumb by optometrical professionals, the 20-20-20 rule.
This advice had been given to me multiple times, and I believe its important for our eye health to stop straining it continuously for extended periods of time. As such, I had decided on this concept for my term project. 
Unfortunately, the biggest issue with this application I created is the amount of processing power required. By nature as a Java application, while it runs fast, it takes up significant memory and cpu time. 
Resultingly, my plan for it as a background process to help self monitor was blocked. However, as a concept I believe it is still valuable, as looking away for only 20 seconds is hardly a significant amount of time to pause one's work and support their own health.
